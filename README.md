# Tilde-On-Shift-Tab

This is an AutoHotKey script that presses Tilde (~) when you press Shift and Tab. 

This is an issue that occurs on 60%-65% keyboards when a manufacturer's keybind for tilde is awful, and you are trying to play Minecraft without playing finger Jenga when typing in commands. 

This program also has compatiblity with my other script for these types of issues! You can find that here: https://github.com/Konpoolu/Backtick-on-Shift-Escape/

**Please note that the .AHK scripts require a download of AutoHotKey V1, which can be found here: https://www.autohotkey.com/ The .EXE versions of the files are flagged by Windows Defender. Hit "More Info" and "Run Anyway" to run the script.**
